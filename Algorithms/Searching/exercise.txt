1) If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
    - BFS
2) If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
    - BFS - (DFS will take long)
3) If the tree is very wide:
    - DFS - (BFS will need too much memory, BFS uses more memory and if many nodes need to keep note/queue of this)
4) If solutions are frequent but located deep into the tree
    - DFS
5) Determining whether a path exists between two nodes
    - DFS
6) Finding the shortest path:
    - BFS
